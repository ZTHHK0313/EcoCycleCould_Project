 EcoCycleCould
 EcoCycleCould is a system composed of intelligent recycling bin modules and a mobile application that connects to the bins via wireless networks to access user data.
 
 The intelligent recycling bins feature standby functions like flammable gas detection and capacity monitoring to ensure safety and usability. When users log in with their ID cards, the lid opens automatically to provide recycling access. Once the waste is deposited, the system identifies and sorts it into designated compartments automatically to help them process the waste classification. Afterward, users earn points that can be redeemed for rewards.  
 
 The mobile app provides the locations of multiple EcoCycleCould smart bins installed across Hong Kong, allowing users to bookmark them. Marked bins display the capacity of each compartment to provide usability situations. The app also organizes and displays score records received from the bins, enabling users to track their recycling performance.
